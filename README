This code is designed around solving the following convex optimization 
problems

minimize ||X-X_tau*G||_1,1

minimize ||X-X_tau*G||_1,1 + gamma || alpha ||_1

minimize ||X-X_tau*G||_2,1 

minimize ||X-X_tau*G||_2,1 + gamma || alpha ||_1


The algorithmic background, motivation, etc. is described in
